I've created this plugin because having to click two different places just to open the settings is just a thing that annoys me...

After you install and activate the plugin;

Press Shift + LeftAlt key combination twice in a server to access the server settings page.

I will probably add more features and customizations to the plugin later√ß, but for now thats it.

thank you!
